abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used on graph data and have shown exceptional performance in the task of link prediction. Despite their effectiveness, GNNs often suffer from high latency due to non-trivial neighborhood data dependency in practical deployments. To address this issue, researchers have proposed methods based on knowledge distillation (KD) to transfer the knowledge from teacher GNNs to student MLPs, which are known to be efficient even with industrial scale data, and have shown promising results on node classification. Nonetheless, using KD to accelerate link prediction is still unexplored. In this work, we start with exploring two direct analogs of traditional KD for link prediction, i.e., predicted logit-based matching and node representation-based matching. Upon observing direct KD analogs do not perform well for link prediction, we propose a relational KD framework, Linkless Link Prediction (LLP). Unlike simple KD methods that match independent link logits or node representations, LLP distills relational knowledge that is centered around each (anchor) node to the student MLP. Specifically, we propose two matching strategies that complement each other, rank-based matching and distribution-based matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP boosts the link prediction performance of MLPs with significant margins, and even outperforms the teacher GNNs on 6 out of 9 benchmarks. LLP also achieves a 776.37Ã— speedup in link prediction inference compared to GNNs on the large scale OGB-Citation2 dataset.
